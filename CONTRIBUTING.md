# Contributing

1. Fork it
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create new pull request (PR)

## Guidelines for pull requests:

1. Respect the coding style of Quasar.
2. Create a new branch for each PR.
3. Single feature or bug-fix per PR.
4. Make single commit per PR.
5. Make your modification compact - don't reformat source code in your request. It makes code review more difficult.
6. PR of reformatting (changing of ws/TAB, line endings or coding style) of source code won't be accepted. Use the issue tracker for your request instead.
7. Typo fixing and code refactoring won't be accepted - please create issues with title started with TYPO to request the changing.

In short: The easier the code review is, the better the chance your pull request will get accepted.
