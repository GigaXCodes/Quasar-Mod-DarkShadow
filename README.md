## Compiling
Open the project `Quasar.sln` in Visual Studio 2019+ with installed .NET desktop development features and [restore the NuGET packages](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/consume-packages/package-restore). Once all packages are installed the project can be compiled as usual by clicking `Build` at the top or by pressing `F6`. The resulting executables can be found in the `Bin` directory. See below which build configuration to choose from.

## Building a client
| Build configuration         | Usage scenario | Description
| ----------------------------|----------------|--------------
| Debug configuration         | Testing        | The pre-defined [Settings.cs](/Quasar.Client/Config/Settings.cs) will be used, so edit this file before compiling the client. You can execute the client directly with the specified settings.
| Release configuration       | Production     | Start `Quasar.exe` and use the client builder.
